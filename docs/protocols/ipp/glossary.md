## Software Development Theory-to-Proof Glossary

### A

**Algorithm Complexity** - Mathematical expression of resource usage (time/space) relative to input size, typically expressed in Big O notation

**Architectural Diagram** - Visual representation of system components, their relationships, and data flow

**Assumption** - Condition accepted as true without proof for the purpose of theoretical development

### B

**Benchmark** - Standardized test or measurement used to evaluate performance against a baseline

**Boundary Condition** - Input values at the extreme limits of acceptable ranges

**Build Artifact** - Compiled code, packages, or files produced by the build process

### C

**CI/CD Pipeline** - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment; automated process for building, testing, and deploying code

**Constraint** - Limitation or restriction that bounds the problem space or solution

**Controlled Experiment** - Test where variables are deliberately manipulated while others are held constant

**Core Algorithm** - Central computational procedure that implements the primary theoretical concept

### D

**Decision Log** - Documented record of architectural and implementation choices with rationales

**Dependency** - External component, library, or condition required for functionality

**Deterministic** - Process that produces the same output given the same input every time

### E

**Edge Case** - Unusual or extreme operating condition that occurs at boundaries of expected behavior

**Empirical Validation** - Verification through observation and experimentation rather than theory alone

**Exit Criteria** - Specific conditions that must be met to complete a phase or task

### F

**Failure Mode** - Specific way in which a system can fail to meet requirements

**Feasibility Analysis** - Systematic evaluation of whether a concept can be practically implemented

**Formal Specification** - Mathematically rigorous description of system behavior and properties

### I

**Integration Point** - Location where separate system components connect and interact

**Invariant** - Property that remains unchanged throughout program execution

**Iteration** - Single cycle through a repeatable process

### L

**Literature Review** - Systematic examination of existing published work in a field

### M

**Measurable Outcome** - Result that can be quantified and compared against defined criteria

**Minimal Viable Implementation** - Smallest functional version that demonstrates core concept

### P

**Performance Benchmark** - Specific metric used to measure execution speed, memory usage, or efficiency

**Precondition** - Condition that must be true before a function or process executes

**Prior Art** - Existing work, implementations, or knowledge that predates and relates to current work

**Proof of Concept** - Preliminary implementation demonstrating feasibility of theoretical approach

### Q

**Quantitative Analysis** - Evaluation using numerical measurements and statistical methods

### R

**Regression Testing** - Tests ensuring new changes don't break existing functionality

**Reproducibility** - Ability to achieve consistent results using the same methods and conditions

**Risk Assessment Matrix** - Tool for identifying and evaluating potential project risks by likelihood and impact

### S

**Statistical Significance** - Mathematical determination that results are unlikely due to chance

**Success Criteria** - Specific, measurable conditions that define successful implementation

### T

**Technical Debt** - Future development cost incurred by choosing expedient over optimal solutions

**Technology Stack** - Collection of programming languages, frameworks, and tools used in a project

**Test Case** - Specific scenario with defined inputs and expected outputs used to verify functionality

**Theoretical Model** - Abstract representation of a system or process based on principles and mathematics

### U

**Unit Test** - Automated test verifying the behavior of individual components in isolation

### V

**Validation** - Process of confirming that implementation meets theoretical requirements

**Version Control** - System for tracking and managing changes to code over time

### W

**White-box Testing** - Testing with knowledge of internal structure and implementation
