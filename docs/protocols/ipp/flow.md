# Implementation Flow

## Software Development Theory-to-Proof Flow

### Main Flow

**Concept** → **Research** → **Design** → **Prototype** → **Build** → **Test** → **Validate** → **Proof**

---

### Detailed Stage Flows

## 1. Concept Formation

```
Initial Idea → Problem Statement → Hypothesis → Success Criteria → Constraints Definition
```

## 2. Research Phase

```
Literature Review → Prior Art Analysis → Gap Identification → Feasibility Study → Risk Assessment
```

## 3. Design Translation

```
Theoretical Model → Formal Specification → Architecture Design → Interface Definition → Data Structure Design
```

## 4. Prototype Development

```
Environment Setup → Core Algorithm → Minimal Implementation → Basic Tests → Proof of Concept
```

## 5. Build Phase

```
Version Control Init → Incremental Development → Unit Tests → Integration → Error Handling → Documentation
```

## 6. Testing Pipeline

```
Unit Testing → Integration Testing → Performance Testing → Edge Case Testing → Regression Testing → Failure Mode Analysis
```

## 7. Validation Process

```
Test Execution → Data Collection → Statistical Analysis → Peer Review → External Validation → Results Comparison
```

## 8. Proof Establishment

```
Evidence Compilation → Reproducibility Check → Final Documentation → Code Repository → Published Artifacts → Demonstration
```

### Parallel Tracks (Ongoing Throughout)

**Documentation Track:**

```
Decision Log → Code Comments → API Docs → Architecture Docs → User Guide → Technical Paper
```

**Quality Track:**

```
Code Review → Security Audit → Performance Monitoring → Technical Debt Tracking → Refactoring
```

**Feedback Loops:**

```
Test Failure → Debug → Fix → Re-test → Validate
Design Flaw → Re-architect → Modify → Re-implement → Verify
Performance Issue → Profile → Optimize → Benchmark → Confirm
```

### Decision Gates (Between Major Phases)

**Concept → Research:**

- Is the problem worth solving?
- Are success criteria measurable?

**Research → Design:**

- Is implementation feasible?
- Does approach improve on prior art?

**Design → Prototype:**

- Are specifications complete?
- Is architecture sound?

**Prototype → Build:**

- Does proof of concept work?
- Are core assumptions valid?

**Build → Test:**

- Is implementation complete?
- Are all components integrated?

**Test → Validate:**

- Do all tests pass?
- Are edge cases handled?

**Validate → Proof:**

- Do results match theory?
- Is implementation reproducible?

This flow structure shows both the linear progression and the iterative nature of moving from theory to proof. Each arrow (→) represents a transition that may require multiple iterations before proceeding to the next stage.
