# Parallel Development Tracks

## Parallel Track Approach

Since everything needs exploration, you can work on multiple tracks simultaneously while maintaining dependencies:

### Track 1: Core Proof (Build)

### Priority: Thread Persistence (Foundation)

```
Build minimal thread → Test serialization → Add event types → Test recovery
↓
Add context transformation → Measure token reduction → Validate accuracy
↓
Create first 3-step agent → Connect to thread → Run autonomous task
```

### Track 2: Theory Refinement (Document)

### Priority: Integration Architecture

```
Define component interfaces → Specify data contracts → Document message formats
↓
Formalize transduction algebra → Create decomposition rules → Define atomic task criteria
↓
Design testing protocols → Establish success metrics → Create validation framework
```

### Track 3: Evidence Collection (Measure)

### Priority: Baseline Metrics

```
Current state benchmarks → Time per task now → Error rates → Context switches
↓
Prototype measurements → Token usage → Execution time → Success rate
↓
Comparative analysis → Theory vs Reality → Adjustments needed
```

## Exploration Order Strategy

### Week 1-2: Foundation

- Build minimal thread implementation (Track 1)
- Document integration architecture (Track 2)
- Measure current baseline metrics (Track 3)

### Week 3-4: First Integration

- Add context transformation (Track 1)
- Formalize task decomposition math (Track 2)
- Test token reduction claims (Track 3)

### Week 5-6: Agent Proof

- Implement first small agent (Track 1)
- Define agent capability boundaries (Track 2)
- Measure autonomous execution rate (Track 3)

## Critical Checkpoints

After each 2-week cycle, evaluate:

1. **Theory Validity**: Does implementation match theory?
2. **Performance**: Are metrics improving toward goals?
3. **Feasibility**: Any fundamental blockers discovered?
4. **Adjustments**: What needs refinement based on findings?

## Documentation During Exploration

Maintain three documents:

### 1. Implementation Log

- What was built
- What worked/failed
- Code snippets
- Performance data

### 2. Theory Adjustments

- Original assumption vs reality
- Required modifications
- New insights
- Updated architecture

### 3. Proof Evidence

- Test results
- Metrics collected
- Success/failure cases
- Reproducibility notes

## Key Questions to Answer Through Exploration

### Thread System

- What's the optimal event granularity?
- How large can threads grow before performance degrades?
- What's the recovery time from a 10,000-event thread?

### Agent Design

- Is 3-10 steps optimal, or should it vary by task type?
- How do agents handle partial failures mid-execution?
- What's the coordination overhead between agents?

### Context Engineering

- What's the actual token reduction achieved?
- Does custom format impact model accuracy?
- How complex can the XML structure be before confusion?

### Integration

- What's the latency between components?
- How do you prevent cascade failures?
- What's the minimum viable monitoring needed?

## Success Indicators

You'll know you're on the right path when:

1. **Early Win**: A thread can be saved and resumed successfully
2. **Momentum**: Each component makes the next easier to build
3. **Clarity**: Vague concepts become concrete implementations
4. **Surprise**: You discover something the theory didn't predict

## Failure Patterns to Watch For

1. **Over-Engineering**: Making it perfect before proving it works
2. **Scope Creep**: Adding features before core is proven
3. **Theory Drift**: Implementation diverging without documenting why
4. **Integration Delay**: Building all parts separately without connecting them

## The Commitment

By exploring all paths, you're committing to:

- Building real code (not just prototypes)
- Measuring actual performance (not assumed)
- Documenting discoveries (both success and failure)
- Adjusting theory based on evidence

This is how theoretical software becomes proven systems. Ready to start with the thread implementation as your first concrete proof?
