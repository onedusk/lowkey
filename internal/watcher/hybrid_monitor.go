package watcher

// hybrid_monitor.go implements the algorithm described in docs/prds/algorithm_design.md,
// blending fsnotify events with safety scans. Profile for large directories.

// TODO: Implement the hybrid monitoring algorithm.
// This component will contain the core logic that blends real-time file system
// events with periodic polling to ensure no changes are missed.
// - Implement the main monitoring loop.
// - This loop should select from the event backend's channel and a timer for polling.
// - When an event is received, it should be processed and sent to the aggregator.
// - When the poll timer fires, it should perform an incremental scan of the watched
//   directories, comparing file signatures with the cache to detect missed changes.
