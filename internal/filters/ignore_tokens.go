package filters

// ignore_tokens.go extracts tokens from glob patterns and paths. Keep it in sync
// with the Bloom filter heuristics; add table-driven tests alongside.

// TODO: Implement the logic for extracting tokens from glob patterns and file paths.
// - Create a function to split glob patterns into meaningful parts (tokens).
// - Create a function to split file paths into tokens.
// - The tokenization strategy should be designed to work effectively with the
//   Bloom filter (e.g., splitting on path separators, special characters).
// - Add comprehensive, table-driven tests to ensure the tokenization is correct
//   for various edge cases.
